# Foodery

Final Project QA Software Development Bootcamp.

### Why am I doing this?

I wanted to create a food delivery app that enables an user to:
1. Register
2. See a list of available restaurants
3. See the menu for a restaurant
4. Create a new order to a chosen restaurant
5. Add products to an order


### How I expected the challenge to go.

I was thinking it would be a great way to implement what I've learned during the past few weeks, learnt a lot from it.


### What went well? / What didn't go as planned?

The idea of the app was straightforward, but the implementation turned up trickier that expected. My initial challenge was how to structure the database tables. Once that was figured out, the data retrieval was straightforward thanks to the many Spring Boot JPA decorators.

The other challenging part was deciding how to structure the endpoints and which features to include in the app.


### Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

The app need a stronger business layer to handle business requirements.

At the moment it is possible to add a new product to an order even though that order is already inside the order. A feature improvement would be to simply add the quantity of that product to the table, rather then creating a new row.

Another major improvement would be to add authentication. At the moment the order endpoint asks for an user_id to know which user to add the order for. Since there is no authentication layer, the API is not secure and any user can add orders for other users.
